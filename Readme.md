# Deepfake Detection Model
by Junghwan Lee, Jaehoon Kim

------------------------------------
## Motivation for this project
>In order to create a way to respond to the development of Deepfake technology, we selected a research topic to develop false image discrimination technology.
>There is a growing confusion caused by serious fake news or fake videos due to the development of Deepfake technology. Due to the vast increase in information, it is difficult to verify the authenticity of the image and the advanced image processing technology makes it difficult to distinguish whether it is a real image or a fake image. In order to prepare for confusion caused by fake videos in this modern society and respond to such abuse, we selected the research topic to study the technology of detecting which videos are made of deepfake.
